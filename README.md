## About ePA

This repository offers technical information for the Electronic Personal Health Record Environment (ePA) as part of the Telematic Infrastructure (TI).

This branch relates to a particular release in context of **ePA Version 2.6**

The provided content comprises normative and supplementary resources and includes implementation guidelines, apis and schemas, examples and additional information.

The current branch accompanies a particular release of specification documents of ePA version 2.6 (a set of normative specification documents for components, producttypes and vendortypes) published on [Fachportal Gematik](https://fachportal.gematik.de/) (see [Branchinformation.md](./Branchinformation.md)  for specific version information and links).

The content in /src is normative in context of requirements defined by those specification docuemnts and is essential for product approvals. Any other content is for information. Normative content here and the documents together form a single product release of the Electronic Personal Health Record system for an approval process.

The affected and covered producttypes are **epa-Aktensystem** and **epa-Frontend des Versicherten**.

ePA-Resources for producttypes **Konnektor** ("Fachmodul ePA") and **KTR-Consumer** ("Fachmodul ePA im KTR-Consumer") are also in scope of a particular ePA release version. As these resources are integrated parts of the named producttypes, release cycles follow the roadmap of those producttypes. See [Fachportal Gematik](https://fachportal.gematik.de/) and repository [api-telematik](https://github.com/gematik/api-telematik), path /conn/phr ("Fachmodul ePA") and /consumer ("Fachmodul ePA im KTR-Consumer") for resources and additional information.
